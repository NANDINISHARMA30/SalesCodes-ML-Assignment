    python predict.py some_image.jpg   ->   0.93

Prints ONE number in [0, 1]:
    0 = real photo,   1 = photo of a screen (recapture / fraud).

Primary path  : the calibrated tree model trained by train.py (model.pkl).
Fallback path : if model.pkl is missing/unloadable, a physically-grounded
                frequency+glare heuristic that needs no training, so the script
                always returns a sensible score and never crashes.

Output is ONLY the number (everything else goes to stderr), so this is safe to
pipe / capture from another process.
